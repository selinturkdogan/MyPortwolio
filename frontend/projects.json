    "description": "The Retro Snake Game project aims to recreate the nostalgic experience of the classic snake game using Unity and C#. The project’s objective is to deliver a functional, interactive, and visually clean game in which the player controls a snake to collect food and avoid collisions. The system features a score tracking mechanism, game over screen, restart and exit options, and a difficulty selection menu that dynamically adjusts the snake’s speed. The design follows modular principles and adheres to software engineering best practices. The game was built as a stand-alone single-player system with scope for future enhancements such as multiplayer mode and additional game mechanics.",
